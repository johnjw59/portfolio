					We’re excited to provide Serious Soups at Home - Healthy, tasty soups delivered directly to your home. Until recently these soups have only been available to commercial vendors in the Vancouver area. But now, you can have restaurant quality soup at your kitchen table. 
					<br /><br />
					Serious Soups is a local company that creates 26 types of soups and sells them commercially in the lower mainland. Serious Soups at Home has branched off to deliver soups to people at home in the Vancouver area.
					<br /><br />
					Being both mothers of two, we care about the quality of food that we feed our respective kids. We love to provide healthy food choices that they actually enjoy. Having convenient and quick meal options on hand allows us to eat well even when we don’t have a lot of time for preparation. We can’t wait to bring the soups that our families enjoy to other families in Vancouver.
					<br /><br />
					Jenna Maxwell and Leah Lim have known each other for 7 years, and been steadily growing closer as friends and now as business partners. They both love to get outside and play with their kids, enjoy their husbands and friends, and spend time with their church communities.
