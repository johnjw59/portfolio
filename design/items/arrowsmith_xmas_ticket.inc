For the past few years they have asked me to design the tickets and posters to advertise the annual event. All I am ever given is the text that the ticket/poster should contain and the &quot;theme verse&quot;, I then have to design something. This is often quite challenging but it's a very good design exercise and I always enjoy doing it.">
