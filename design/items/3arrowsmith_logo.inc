<a href="" data-largesrc="img/arrowsmith_logo.png" data-title="Arrowsmith Baptist Church Logo" data-description="In my home town of Port Alberni, my family has been attending <a href='http://www.arrowsmithchurch.com' target='_blank'>Arrowsmith Baptist Church</a> for quite a long time. Since I have been attending my whole life, I've always really enjoyed giving back. After the church finally decided to join the 21st century and purchase a digital projector, they needed updated, digital materials that they could use for projecting, one of which was the church logo. I offered to refresh the logo and clean it up (the old one was hand drawn) and this was result. It was actually a bit of an honour to be able to do this as the logo has been placed throughout Port Alberni and can been seen on various signs and even a bench around the town.">
