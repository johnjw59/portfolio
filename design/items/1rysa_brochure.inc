One of things I did while there was updating the design of all of their marketing materials, the first of which was this brochure for all the programs they hold. I was provided only with the text of the brochure and their database of img. The design of the brochure ended up influencing all the other materials I would design for them to give everything at the agency a cohesive look.">
