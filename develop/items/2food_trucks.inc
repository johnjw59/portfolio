<a href="" data-largesrc="img/food_trucks.png" data-title="Vancouver Food Trucks" data-description="At UBC in winter term 1 (September to December) in 2013 I took a Software Engineering course (CPSC 310). The big project for that class was to develop a web application, pulling data from <a href='http://data.vancouver.ca' target='_blank'>Data Vancouver</a> and taking advantage of social media features provided by Facebook/Google/Twitter. My team, consisting of myself and 3 others, chose to make an app that would plot all the food trucks in Vancouver on a map and allow users to rate and review them. You can view the finished product <a href='http://van-food-trucks.appspot.com/' target='_blank'>here</a>.<br /><br /> 
Personally, I was responsible for the implementations of Google Maps as well as working on the Facebook Like/Share button. The project was written in Java and compiled using GWT (you can view the source code <a href='https://github.com/johnjw59/Vancouver_Food_Trucks' target='_blank'>here</a> if that's your thing).">
