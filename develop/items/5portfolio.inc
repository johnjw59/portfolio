<a href="" data-largesrc="img/portfolio.png" data-title="Portfolio" data-description="Look familiar? It feels weird to feature my portfolio on my portfolio but I did create this website from scratch (no templates here!) and I do think some of the stuff going on under the hood deserves some attention. This is actually the first website I've created with PHP in mind. After being exposed to PHP in the Summer of 2013, I started to get really excited thinking about all the great things it could do for me and how much easier it would make building a website. I had had to make a small portfolio for a job application that summer as well which got me thinking that maybe I should be putting everything I have worked on online.<br /><br /> 
Each of these gallery pages is built dynamically by scanning a directory and structuring the HTML automatically using PHP. I also wrote the Javascript for the dynamic resizing of the homepage. This project was really a great learning experience for me and will hopefully come in handy! It also won the <strong>Judges Choice Award</strong> in the 2014 e-Portfolio Competition at UBC!<br /><br />
I'd give you the link to this site but I think you've already found it...">
