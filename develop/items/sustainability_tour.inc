<a href="" data-largesrc="img/sustainability_tour.png" data-title="UBC Sustainability Tour" data-description="When I first transferred to UBC in September of 2012, one of the classes I was taking was on Software Construction (CPSC 210). For those at UBC this was to be the first  real-world programming course they took, introducing them to development in Java. I already had some exposure to Java but there was still much for me to learn. The end-of-term project for this course was to implement the routing services for a UBC Sustainability Tour app for Android. I used Open Street Map to get a JSON object containing the waypoints the user needed to travel through on their tour and then plotted the route on the map.">
