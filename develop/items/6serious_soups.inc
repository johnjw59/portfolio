<a href="" data-largesrc="img/serious_soups.png" data-title="Serious Soups at Home" data-description="This was the first, large-scale website I built. It was an end-of-term project for a Web Development course I took at Langara College in Vancouver. The website was built for a small soup selling business here in Vancouver. After I finished the course I continued to upkeep and work on the website adding jQuery based features such as randomly including different pictures on the homepage and another which used cookies to inform users of changes to pricing only on their first visit.<br /><br />While the website is no longer active, you can see a copy I have of it <a href='../serious_soups/' target='_blank'>here</a>.">
