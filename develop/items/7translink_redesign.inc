<a href="" data-largesrc="img/translink_redesign.png" data-title="Vancouver Transit Ticket Kiosk Prototype" data-description="As you can probably tell from looking around this website, I am very interested in design. This is why I decided to take a Human-Computer Interaction course at UBC in the September-December term in 2013. The project for the course was to redesign an existing interface. My team and I decided to redesign the ticket dispensing kiosks at the Skytrain stations in Vancouver. The project consisted of doing a usability study of the current interface, a low-fidelity prototype and medium-fidelity prototype of our redesign, another usability study except with our new interface and finally a presentation. You can view our medium-fidelity prototype <a href='../translink_redesign/1-home.html' target='_blank'>here</a> and watch a recording of our end-of-term presentation <a class='fancybox fancybox.iframe' href='http://www.youtube.com/embed/p9C4NRnFJew'>here</a>.">
