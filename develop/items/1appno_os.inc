<a href="" data-largesrc="img/appno_os.png" data-title="Appnovation OS" data-description="I worked on this site during my time at <a href='http://www.appnovation.com/' target='_blank'>Appnovation</a> on a co-op work term. The site is meant to develop a community around the open source projects the company creates. I was the sole back-end developer on the site and was responsible for a complete upgrade/redesign from what they already had which, when I was put on the project, was just a basic Drupal site. The only thing that really remains from the initial implementation is the forums.<br /><br />
Being the only back-end dev on the project meant I was responsible in assisting the front-end and fixing any problems QA found by myself. This gave me a test of being a lead on a project as I often had people coming to me for help or problems. It also meant I couldn't rely on anyone elses expereince when solving problems; I really had to look and figure things out myself which meant I learned a lot.<br /><br />
